Learning Transformers Architecture by experimenting using Pytorch.
I will try to understand Transformers in my way which is to experiment and code.
After that I will build a question answering system using Squad. 
I will use pre build models for this and see if I can improve by retraining some parts of it.
Other goal is to document the entire process of learning.
